### Introduction

DataLab is an open-source environment for data science team handling daily operations. It installed some of the most popular data science tools including Airflow, Spark, Jupyter lab and famous python packages including Keras, Scikit-learn, Pandas and Numpy. DataLab integrates those tools with custom packages. 

Aim of this project is to save time and cost for any data science team on infrastructure setup. A data science team can start designing the algorithm and etl process without pain.

To make the data science daily work easy and smooth, DataLab also introduces some guidelines for best practice.
